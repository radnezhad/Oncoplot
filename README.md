# Oncoplot
Oncoplots are used to visualize and summarize different types of mutations in patients. Here we take a MAF file as an input and process it to visualize an oncoplot with using any package.
We tried to recreate the first oncoplot of this webpage (https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/maftools/inst/doc/oncoplots.html). In this webpage, oncoplots are visualized by maftools. We tried to do the same without using any package. The MAF file and the code are uploaded.
